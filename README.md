# LVC-HostsManager

Update (Dennis):
As the original author, I've forked the project, because Tobias does not seem to be able to maintain- or develop it any further. We have canceled friendship a few years ago because bad stuff has happened that i don't want to talk about here.<br>
PLEASE POST ANY ISSUES IN THIS REPOSITORY<br><br>

This program allows you to update your hosts file with a downloaded blacklist.<br>
The blacklisted traffic is being redirected to a blockpage (or a IP/localhost).<br>
Therefore tracking is being reduced to a minimum.<br>
You are also being protected from spam ads and more.<br>
(In short...)<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3><b>And now in long... ;-)</b></h3>
The Hosts-File-Downloader & -Updater pulls a new/updated hosts-file from any online source (URL) you want.<br>
The Hosts-Files-List is saved by the app - the update can be automated.<br>
More informations to the hosts-file can be found here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hosts_(file)<br>
