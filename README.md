# HostsManager
This program allows you to update your hosts file with a downloaded blacklist.<br>
The blacklisted traffic is being redirected to a blockpage (or a URL/localhost).<br>
Therefore tracking is being reduced to a minimum.<br>
You are also being protected from spam ads and more.<br>
(In short...)<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3><b>And now in long... ;-)</b></h3>
- The Hosts-File-Downloader & -Updater pulls a new/updated hosts-file from any online source (URL).<br>
- The Hosts-Files-List is saved by the app.<br>
More to the hosts-file: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hosts_(file)<br>
