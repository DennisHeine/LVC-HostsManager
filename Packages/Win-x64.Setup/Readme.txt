LV-Crew HostsManager

This program allows you to update your hosts-file with a blacklist.
The blacklisted traffic is being redirected to a IP/Path (localhost).
Therfore you are protected from tracking and from spam ads and from whatever you want.
(In short...)



In long ...:
- The Hosts-File-Downloader & -Updater pulls a new/updated hosts-file from any online source (URL).
- The Hosts-Files-List is saved by the app.
More to the hosts-file: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hosts_(file)

Many antivirus programs do block the hosts file in a way, that we can't unblock it.
Please refer to your antivirus program's manual to find out how to disable hosts file protection.
