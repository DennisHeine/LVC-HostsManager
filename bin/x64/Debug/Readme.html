<h2>LV-Crew HostsManager</h2><br>
This program allows you to update your hosts file with a downloaded blacklist.<br>
The blacklisted traffic is being redirected to a whitepage (or a URL/localhost).<br>
Therefore tracking is being reduced to a minimum.<br>
You are also being protected from spam ads and more.<br>
(In short...)<br><br>
