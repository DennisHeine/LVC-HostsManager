LV-Crew HostsManager

This program allows you to update your hosts file with a downloaded blacklist.
The blacklisted traffic is being redirected to a whitepage (or a URL/localhost).
Therefore tracking is being reduced to a minimum.
You are also being protected from spam ads and more.
(In short...)

- The Hosts-Files-List is saved by the app.
