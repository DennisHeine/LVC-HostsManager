# HostsManager
This program allows you to update your hosts-file with a blacklist.
The blacklisted traffic is being redirected to a IP/Path (localhost).
Therfore you are protected from tracking and from spam ads and from whatever you want.
(In short...)

Long:
The Hosts-File-Downloader & -Updater pulls a new/updated hosts-file from any online source (URL).
The Hosts-File is saved in the app.
